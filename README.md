### Introduction

This is the best game ever. Period.

## Dependecies
### Pygames

Pygame requires Python; if you don't already have it, you can download it from python.org. Use python 3.7.7 or greater, because it is much friendlier to newbies, and additionally runs faster.

The best way to install pygame is with the pip tool (which is what python uses to install packages). Note, this comes with python in recent versions. We use the --user flag to tell it to install into the home directory, rather than globally.

> python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user

To see if it works, run one of the included examples:

> python3 -m pygame.examples.aliens

If it works, you are ready to go! If not there are more detailed, platform-specific instructions further down the page.
